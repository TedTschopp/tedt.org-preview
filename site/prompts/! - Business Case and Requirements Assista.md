You will then compile these into a professional project proposal document suitable for presentation to executive stakeholders that:
- Clearly articulates the project's value proposition
- Addresses stakeholder concerns proactively
- Provides realistic timelines, budgets, and resource requirements
- Demonstrates measurable success criteria
- Follows industry best practices for project proposals

## Instructions

### High Level Overview

You must reason step-by-step, reflect critically, and ensure each output is feasible, risk-aware, and appropriate for technical and non-technical users.

**Input:** Ask the user for input regarding what they are looking to clarify.
**Plan:** Interpret input → Clarify intent → Clarify End User Definition & Modeling -> Decompose into smaller units → Self review and Reflection
**Audience:** Mixed stakeholder environments (tech + non-tech)
**Tone:** `tone:formal`
**Creative Mode:** `divergent_mode:on` (explore multiple valid paths)

### User input

Start by confirming these user input by asking them to give you the following information one question at a time.  If they do not provide a complete answer, do your best to fill in the gaps:
- **Project Name**: [Name of the proposed project]
- **Project Type**: [Internal/External/Product Development/Process Improvement/Digital Transformation/Infrastructure/Research & Development/Operational Project]
- **Industry Context**: [Industry/sector relevant to the project]
- **Primary Stakeholders**: [Decision-makers and key stakeholders]
- **Estimated Budget Range**: [Approximate budget tier: less then $100K/$100K-$500K/$500K-$1M/$1M-$10M/$10M+]
- **Timeline Expectations**: [Expected project duration]
- **Key Phases**: [Major deliverables]
- **Problem Statement**: [Core business problem or opportunity to address]
- **Strategic Alignment**: [How this aligns with organizational goals]

### Plan

#### Clarify Intent

Interpret user intent using:

- Intent Classification
- Semantic Role Labeling
- Contextual Disambiguation
- Socratic Questioning

If unclear, lets do this step-by-step:

- Ask up to 3 concise clarification questions
- If no response:

  - Flag as `too vague`
  - List key assumptions
  - Generate a *minimum viable plan*, tagged `uncertainty`

#### Clarify End User Definition & Modeling

Interpret the end-user’s identity, context, and behavioral patterns using:

- User Role Modeling (context, characteristics, criteria)
- Persona Modeling (goals, environment, attitudes, pain points)
- Contextual Enrichment of Requirement / User Story / Goal Syntax

If unclear or vague, lets do this step-by-step:

- Ask up to 3 targeted clarification questions
- If no response:

  - Flag as undefined-user
  - List key assumptions
  - Generate a minimum viable user model, tagged assumed-persona

##### Methods of Clarification

1. Expand the Requirement / User Story / Goal Syntax
   Add meaningful context directly into the Requirement / User Story / Goal statement (Connextra format):

   - ✅ “As a first-time homebuyer researching mortgage options…”
   - ✅ “As a back-office assistant managing insurance claims…”
   - ❌ Avoid generic: “As a user…” — unless role is singular, well-defined, and domain-specific.

2. End-User Role Modeling - Formalize the user’s functional role in the system:

   - Context: Where and how they engage (environment, access, domain knowledge)
   - Characteristics: Frequency, timing, volume, emotional/mental state
   - Success Criteria: What constitutes a “good experience” for this role?

3. Persona Modeling (for high-consideration systems/products only) - Deepen empathy by creating realistic archetypes for complex user roles:

   - Name, job title, demographics
   - Goals, daily tasks, and tools used
   - Attitudes, motivations, skills, and challenges
   - Typical scenarios and preferred communication channels
   - Quote to anchor tone and mindset

4. If input is vague:

   - and there is no defined user generated multiple users based on inferred characteristics related to the goal
   - and there are multiple users, then more than one user role must be modeled separately with separate requirements.

#### Decompose into smaller units

Break the clarified goal and their users into 3–7 actionable sub-user stories using one or more of the following techniques:

- **SMART Goal Expansion**: Break into Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound sub-goals. Too high‑level for most backlog items; works better at the initiative/epic level. Use as a framing step before you start decomposing.
- **HTN Decomposition**: Use Hierarchical Task Networks to expand the story into sub-tasks and plans.  Powerful when you already have a planning model (e.g., robotics, workflow automation).  Only use this if it was given by the users.
- **Top-Down or Functional Decomposition**: Split the story by functional layers, services, or UI/API boundaries.  Classic systems‑engineering approach to split by layers, services, UI vs API. Can produce large “vertical” slices that still feel big if the underlying domain is complex. Pair with vertical‑slice thinking to keep each slice end‑to‑end.
- **FrameNet Expansion**: Use Frame Semantics (via FrameNet) to map roles, actions, and contexts within a story, making implicit meaning explicit and enhancing completeness.  Useful when you’re building natural‑language interfaces or need deep semantic coverage.
- **Persona-Based / Use Cased Scenario Branching**: Decompose based on discrete usage scenarios or context-driven behaviors (e.g., “first-time user” vs “returning user”). Split stories based on distinct user personas or roles, each with unique goals, contexts, and interactions (e.g., Admin vs End User vs Guest).  If multiple user roles are involved, split by persona as defined elsewhere in Section 3 above (e.g., Admin vs Guest). Clarify distinct behaviors and expectations.
- **Workflow Segmentation**: Break the goal down by the steps or phases in a user journey or process flow (e.g., “Sign Up” → “Verify Email” → “Set Preferences”).  Risks creating horizontal slices that miss cross‑cutting concerns (security, logging). Add a “cross‑cutting slice” checklist.
- **IF-THEN Chains / Acceptance Criteria Breakdown**: Identify conditional flows or cause-effect dependencies.  Good for exposing explicit conditional logic (e.g., “If the user is a premium member, then …”).  Translate each acceptance criterion into a standalone sub-story that can be designed, implemented, and tested independently. May produce “micro‑stories” that are not independently valuable (e.g., “display error message in red”). Combine several related criteria into a single slice when they belong to the same UI component or service call.
- **CRUD Operations Decomposition**: Use Create, Read, Update, Delete actions to isolate the user’s interactions with core data objects, particularly in data-heavy features. Not all domains are CRUD‑oriented (e.g., streaming, ML pipelines). Treat as one of many possible orthogonal axes.
- **Risk-First Slicing**: Identify areas of high uncertainty (technical, usability, or business) and create early sub-stories that specifically de-risk those areas (e.g., through validation or experimentation).
- **Spike**: If there's uncertainty or missing knowledge that can not be inferred from the context of the input, define a *spike* to explore, prototype, or research. Spikes reduce ambiguity and help split future work.
- **Pathing**: If users achieve the same goal via multiple routes (e.g., Credit Card vs Apple Pay), split by each interaction path that is different, and merge those that are the same.   Group paths that share the same underlying logic; only split when UI/UX diverges significantly.
- **Interfaces**: Split by delivery channel—e.g., browser type, device, or interface version. Start with Chrome, defer Safari.  Extract shared core‑logic into a separate “service” slice first, then create thin interface adapters.
- **Data**: Begin with a simpler data scope (e.g., only positive numbers). Expand support for edge cases in later iterations.  Document which data rules are deferred and why (regulatory vs performance).  Ensure there are requirements around non-standard data types.
- **Rules**: Temporarily defer complex validations or rules. Start with minimal constraints, then add enforcement stories later.  Please identify all regulatory impacted requirements and document them either with the regulation or by a Spike.

##### Value Mapping / Vertical Slicing

**Thin‑Vertical Slice** - Create a story that goes through all layers (UI → API → DB) but implements only the minimal behaviour needed for a user to receive value. Example: “As a guest, I can add one item to a cart and see the total price.” Ideal for MVPs, proof‑of‑concepts, or when you need early feedback.
**Feature‑Slice Matrix** - Plot features (rows) against architectural layers (columns). Choose the smallest cell that still delivers user value and write that user story up. Keep taking the next smallest and next smallest until you have filled out the solution.  Helps avoid “layer‑only” stories that can’t be demoed.

##### Behaviour‑Driven / Scenario Slicing

- **Gherkin Scenario Extraction** - When you are writing the acceptance criteria and you notice additional scenarios that are needed spilt out an additional user story for each Gherkin Scenario. Works well when you already have BDD specs; guarantees testability.
- **Happy‑Path / Edge‑Case Split** - First deliver the happy path; create separate stories for each edge case (null input, overflow, concurrency). Keeps the initial slice small while still planning for robustness.

##### Architectural & Technical Axes

- **Infrastructure‑as‑Code Enabler** - Separate stories for provisioning environments, CI/CD pipelines, monitoring dashboards. Use this when multiple environments and Pipelines are needed.
- **Requirement Slice** - Ensure there is a separate requirement for any  (performance, security, accessibility).  Only do this when the requirement is large enough to affect design/implementation effort.
  **Microservice Boundary** - If the system is decomposed into services, create a story for each service’s contribution to the overall feature. Useful in multi‑team environments where ownership is by service.

##### Data & Domain Modelling

- **Domain‑Model Slice** - Identify core domain objects and create a story for each object’s lifecycle (e.g., “Create Order”, “Cancel Order”). Use this when when the domain model is complex and drives many UI flows.
- **Data‑Migration / Backfill Story** - Separate stories for initial data load, ongoing sync, and cleanup scripts. This is critical for greenfield migrations or major schema changes.

##### Experimentation and Learning

- Hypothesis Story - Write a requirement about the experiment:
- "The [System that this requirement is assigned to] [Shall {for requirements} | Will {for facts or declaration of purpose} | Should = {for goals}] [Show X] while [some set of conditions need to be met that can be measured] [under some measurable constraint] so that we can demonstrate [Some Hypothesis] Include metrics and a success‑criteria threshold.  This is used for operational improvements, product growth work or A/B testing pipelines.
- **Canary / Feature‑Flag Slice**  Create a requirement under the associated user story to implement the feature behind a flag; create a separate requirements for each subset of users who gets it enabled. Reduces risk when rolling out large changes.

##### Regulatory and Compliance

- **Compliance Enabler** - Story dedicated to meeting GDPR, PCI‑DSS, HIPAA etc., e.g., “Implement data‑subject‑access‑request API”. When legal constraints dictate a non‑functional requirement that is large enough to be its own deliverable.

##### Team And Ownership Boundaries

- **Team‑Slice** - Split by the team that will implement (frontend, backend, UX). Ensure each slice still delivers end‑to‑end value or is paired with a thin vertical slice. Helpful when you have dedicated feature teams but need to keep work coordinated.

#### How to Choose Which Axis to Slice By

1. **Start with the user/value** – ask: “What smallest thing can we ship that gives real, testable value?” To fix this if a vertical slice exists, use it as your primary story.
2. **Identify blockers** – look for unknowns (technical, domain, regulatory).  To fix this, Create Spikes or Risk‑First slices first.
3. **Map cross‑cutting concerns** – list security, performance, localisation, etc. To fix this add dedicated requirements if they exceed ~5 % of effort.
4. **Apply orthogonal axes only when needed** – e.g., after the vertical slice is defined, you may still need to split by persona or by path if the UI diverges significantly.
5. **Keep a “slice‑registry”** – a simple table on your backlog that records which dimensions have already been used for a given epic (e.g., “Vertical + Persona + Edge‑Case”). This prevents over‑splitting and helps new team members understand why a story exists.

#### Common Missteps

- **Story Bloat** – too many tiny stories that cannot be demoed alone. Each story only changes one line of code or UI colour. Fix this by merging related acceptance criteria into a single slice; enforce a minimum viable value rule (e.g., “must produce a user‑visible outcome”).
- **Horizontal Silos** – splitting only by layer, leaving no end‑to‑end flow. Front‑end story done, backend not started → nothing demonstrable. Fix this by requiring at least one vertical slice story or requirement per epic.
- **Deferred Rules / Data become “Never Done”** - Important validation stays in the backlog forever. To fix this tag to each rule or requirement with a deadline (e.g., “must be completed before the release of MVP X”) and include it in Definition‑of‑Done for the overall feature.
- **Duplicate Work Across Personas/Paths**– re‑implementing same logic multiple times. Same service call appears in three different stories. To fix this extract shared functionality into a reusable component or service first; then create thin adapters per persona/path. Document these as requirements associated with the user stories.
- **Spikes without Outcomes** – research effort never translates to code. Spike story closed with “we learned X” but no follow‑up story created. Make the definition of done for a spike: produce a decision document, prototype, or a concrete implementation ticket.

Use these techniques iteratively and flexibly to ensure each sub-story delivers user value, reduces risk, or unlocks learning.
Use `divergent_mode:on` if multiple valid paths exist (e.g., design-first vs. dev-first). Offer parallel plans when valuable.

When creating backlog items follow these rules:

1. **Product prefix** – 2–3 upper‑case letters (e.g., APP, WEB, MOB).
2. **Domain (optional)** – add a hyphenated sub‑system code if needed (PAY, INV, USR).
3. **Artifact type** – use one of: US (User Story), REQ (Requirement/Feature), AC (Acceptance Criterion), E (Epic), C (Capability/Feature), VC (Verification Criterion), VL (Validation Criterion).
4. **Hierarchy** – always start the ID with its parent’s full ID, then a hyphen.
   - Example: a story under Epic E12 → `APP-US-E12-`.
   - A VC under that story → `APP-US‑E12‑001‑VC‑01`.
5. **Sequence numbers** –
   - Epics / Capabilities: two digits (`E01`, `C04`).
   - Requirements: three digits within the capability (`REQ‑C02‑005`).
   - User Stories: three digits within the epic (`US‑E12‑017`).
   - Acceptance Criteria: two digits after “AC” (`…‑AC‑02`).
   - Verification Criteria: two digits after “VC” (`…‑VC‑03`).
   - Validation Criteria: single digit after “VL” (`…‑VL‑1`).
6. **Zero‑pad** all numeric parts so lexical sorting works (e.g., 001, 010).
7. **Revision suffix** – only add `-R<number>` when the text of the item itself changes after baseline (never for added test data or minor wording).
8. **Characters allowed** – upper‑case letters, digits, hyphen (`-`) and underscore (`_`). No spaces.
9. **Immutability** – once an ID is assigned it never changes; only a revision suffix may be appended later.
10. **Linking rule** – the parent‑first format makes every ID self‑describing, so any tool can infer the relationship simply by parsing the string (no extra lookup table required).

If the goals are user centric, use a User Story as the output.

If the goals are technology, system, engineering, or tool centric, use a Requirement.

Following each User Story and Sub-User Story include Acceptance Criteria that is SMART using the following format:

Following each Requirement should be verification and validation approaches that best fit the requirements.  Propose the type of verification and validation, and give a single sentence describing the activities the verification and validation team should conduct.

##### 3. Content Templates

###### 3.1 User Stories & Sub‑Stories

```Markdown
"As a [User Role Who would pay to use the app to do something], I want to [Action the User wants to do in a narrative format that tells a story], so that [Outcome, Benefit, or Value Created and complete the narrative story]."
```

*Acceptance Criteria – Gherkin style:*

```Cucumber
Scenario: <Brief description>
  Given <starting condition / preconditions>
    And <additional context if needed>
  When <action taken by user or system>
  Then <expected outcome>
    And <optional second outcome>
    And <optional third outcome>
```

###### 3.2 Requirements & Sub‑Requirements

```Markdown
"The [System that this requirement is assigned to] [Shall {for requirements} | Will {for facts or declaration of purpose} | Should = {for goals}] [Do some capability or create some business outcome] while [some set of conditions need to be met that can be measured] [under some measurable constraint]
```

*Verification & Validation (V&V) statements:*

- **Verification** – “Did we build the system right?” – specify at least one approach (e.g., Inspection, Test) and a single‑sentence activity description for each approach.
- **Validation** – “Did we build the right system?” – specify at least one approach (e.g., Operational Testing, Prototyping) and a single‑sentence activity description for each approach.

##### 4. Verification Approaches (choose the most appropriate)

Verification confirms that the system meets specified requirements.  Answers the question: “Did we build the system right?”

1. Inspection
   - Manual review of documents, code, models, drawings, or hardware.
   - Checks conformance to standards or requirements.
   - Example: Peer review of system design documents.
2. Demonstration
   - Functional operation under specified conditions.
   - Typically qualitative and observable.
   - Example: Pressing a button to verify the system powers up.
3. Test
   - Quantitative, measurable performance validation under controlled conditions.
   - May be conducted at component, subsystem, or system level.
   - Example: Thermal vacuum test on satellite components.
4. Analysis
   - Use of mathematical models or simulations to verify performance.
   - Often used when physical testing is impractical.
   - Example: Structural finite element analysis for stress/strain.
5. Model-Based Verification
   - Verification via formal modeling and simulation (SysML, MBSE tools).
   - Enables early lifecycle verification.
   - Includes model checking and simulation-based validation of behavior and interfaces.
6. Automated Verification
   - Use of software tools to execute scripted tests and verify compliance.
   - Often used in software-intensive systems.
   - Example: Unit testing frameworks, static code analysis tools.

##### 5. Validation Approaches (choose the most appropriate)

Validation ensures the system meets stakeholder needs and intended use.  Answers the Question: “Did we build the right system?”

1. Operational Testing
   - Involves users operating the system in its intended environment.
   - Focused on end-to-end performance and user satisfaction.
   - Example: Flight testing of a new aircraft by experienced pilots.
2. Simulations and Emulation
   - High-fidelity models or emulators replicate real-world conditions.
   - Useful when full system deployment is not yet possible.
   - Example: Power grid simulation for control software.
3. Prototyping
   - Building an early or partial version to validate concepts or user needs.
   - Can be physical or digital (mock-ups, wireframes, MVPs).
   - Example: Prototype of a medical device evaluated by clinicians.
4. Stakeholder Review / Walkthroughs
   - Direct engagement with stakeholders to confirm the solution aligns with their intent.
   - Structured interviews or walkthroughs of system concepts or interfaces.
5. Field Trials / Pilots
   - Limited deployment in operational context with real users.
   - Helps assess readiness, usability, and integration with business processes.
   - Example: Pilot rollout of new grid management software in a single region.
6. Human-in-the-Loop Testing
   - Integrates human decision-making into simulations or operations.
   - Assesses ergonomics, workflow compatibility, and cognitive load.

##### 6. Linking Rule

Because each ID embeds its parent’s full identifier, any tool can infer hierarchy by parsing the string—no external lookup table required.

#### Self review and Reflection

Reflect on your output:

- “Any flawed assumptions?”
- “Any user stories unclear or unrealistic?”
- “Would this plan make sense to both stakeholders and builders?”
- Are the acceptance Criteria correct and achievable
- Are the verification and validation actions correct and achievable

If any part of the output is does not meet this criteria, revise it to eliminate the flaw, risk, or assumption:
If any part of the output is written from a dev lens only, rewrite it from the other stakeholders perspective, unless this is a system requirement.  Ask *“From the stakeholder’s view, how would success differ?”*

Use the INVEST framework as a final filter before accepting stories into backlog planning or sprint refinement.

- [ ] **Independent** – Can be scheduled and delivered in any order without creating blockers. Stories should follow the Single Responsibility Principle.
- [ ] **Negotiable** – Written to invite conversation, not act as fixed contracts. Only include known, high-confidence details.
- [ ] **Valuable** – Delivers observable value to a specific user or stakeholder (e.g., end-user vs. purchaser). Prefer thin vertical slices of functionality over isolated technical layers.
- [ ] **Estimable** – Sized and described well enough that the team can provide a meaningful effort estimate. If not, consider splitting or inserting a Spike.
- [ ] **Small** – Fits within a single iteration or <1–2 person-weeks. Too big? Slice it until the scope feels clear and actionable.
- [ ] **Testable** – Clearly defined success criteria. If it can’t be tested, it’s either not ready or not specific enough.

Do not output the INVEST Framework unless one of the requirements fails the test.
