# ADR-001: Prompt Details Page UX and Accessibility Improvements

## Status

**Status:** Accepted

## Context

The current prompt details page (used by the Universal Content Creator demo and other prompt pages) has several design and UX limitations that impact user experience, particularly on mobile devices and for accessibility compliance. Based on review of the live site at <https://tedt.org/universal-content-creator-demo/>, the following issues have been identified:

### Current Problems

1. **Mobile Responsiveness Issues**
   - AI provider buttons overflow on smaller screens
   - Form variables section lacks proper mobile stacking
   - Card layouts have suboptimal spacing on mobile devices

2. **User Experience Flow Problems**
   - Variable form toggle button placement is not intuitive
   - No visual indication when variables are being processed
   - Missing loading states for AI provider button interactions
   - No clear indication of required vs optional fields

3. **Accessibility Compliance Gaps**
   - Missing focus indicators for keyboard navigation
   - Potential color contrast issues
   - Inadequate form validation feedback beyond CSS classes
   - Missing ARIA labels and descriptions

4. **Content Organization Issues**
   - "Prompts in this Series" section contains hardcoded placeholder content
   - Poor visual separation between prompt content and metadata
   - Related prompts section lacks visual appeal

### Technical Constraints

- Must maintain existing Jekyll/Liquid templating structure
- Must remain backward compatible with existing prompt posts
- Must work across development, test, and production environments
- Must follow Bootstrap 5.3.0 design system conventions

### Business Requirements

- Improve user experience for prompt customization
- Ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Maintain consistent site-wide design patterns
- Support mobile-first responsive design

## Decision

We will implement comprehensive UX and accessibility improvements to the prompt details page system with the following approach:

### 1. Mobile-First Responsive Design

- Implement responsive button stacking for AI provider buttons using CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Add collapsible sections for better mobile navigation
- Optimize form layouts with improved spacing and touch targets
- Use Bootstrap responsive utilities consistently

### 2. Enhanced Form UX

- Add visual loading indicators and state feedback
- Implement better validation messaging with ARIA support
- Add progressive disclosure for complex forms
- Provide clear required field indicators

### 3. Accessibility Enhancements

- Add comprehensive ARIA labels and descriptions
- Implement proper keyboard navigation support
- Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA color contrast compliance
- Add screen reader friendly feedback

### 4. Improved Visual Hierarchy

- Better typography hierarchy implementation
- Enhanced button states and hover feedback
- Subtle animations for state transitions
- Improved content organization and separation

### 5. Dynamic Content Features

- Replace hardcoded "Prompts in this Series" with dynamic functionality
- Improve related prompts display logic
- Better metadata presentation

## Implementation Approach

### Files to be Modified

1. `_layouts/prompt-details.html` - Main layout improvements
2. `_includes/prompts/prompt-variables-form.html` - Form UX enhancements  
3. `_includes/prompts/prompt-variables-styles.html` - CSS improvements and responsive design
4. Create new test files in `/tests/` directory

### Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests** - Form validation logic, variable processing
2. **Integration Tests** - Component interactions, responsive behavior
3. **Accessibility Tests** - WCAG compliance, keyboard navigation
4. **Cross-browser Tests** - Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge compatibility
5. **Mobile Device Tests** - iOS/Android responsive behavior

### Implementation Phases

1. **Phase 1 (High Priority)**: Mobile responsiveness and basic accessibility
2. **Phase 2 (Medium Priority)**: Enhanced UX features and visual polish
3. **Phase 3 (Low Priority)**: Advanced features like save/bookmark functionality

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Complete Redesign

- **Pros**: Could address all issues comprehensively
- **Cons**: Would break backward compatibility, require extensive testing
- **Verdict**: Rejected due to backward compatibility requirements

### Alternative 2: Minimal CSS-Only Fixes

- **Pros**: Low risk, quick implementation
- **Cons**: Wouldn't address fundamental UX and accessibility issues
- **Verdict**: Rejected as insufficient for user needs

### Alternative 3: Third-Party Component Library

- **Pros**: Mature, tested components
- **Cons**: Would introduce new dependencies, break existing design system
- **Verdict**: Rejected to maintain design consistency

## Consequences

### Positive

- Improved user experience across all devices
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- Better SEO through improved semantic structure
- Enhanced mobile usability
- Consistent design system implementation

### Negative

- Requires comprehensive testing across multiple browsers and devices
- May need iterative refinement based on user feedback
- Increases complexity of the component system slightly

### Mitigation Strategies

- Comprehensive test suite to catch regressions
- Gradual rollout with monitoring
- Documentation updates for maintainability
- User feedback collection for continuous improvement

## Compliance and Standards

This decision ensures compliance with:

- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards
- Mobile-first responsive design principles
- Jekyll/Bootstrap 5.3.0 design system conventions
- Site coding best practices and naming conventions

## Success Metrics

1. **Performance**: Page load time remains under 3 seconds
2. **Accessibility**: 100% WCAG 2.1 AA compliance on automated testing
3. **Mobile UX**: Improved user task completion rates on mobile devices
4. **Cross-browser**: Consistent functionality across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
5. **Maintainability**: Clear code structure with comprehensive documentation
