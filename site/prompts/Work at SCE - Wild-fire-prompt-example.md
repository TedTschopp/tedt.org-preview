# **A good example (wildfire risk):**

## Narrative.

Create an end‑to‑end Wildfire Ignition Risk & PSPS Decision‑Support system for a Southern California investor‑owned utility operating in High Fire Threat District (HFTD) Tiers 2–3. The objective is to reduce equipment‑caused ignitions by 25% year over year while cutting Public Safety Power Shutoff (PSPS) customer‑minutes by 15%, without compromising safety or regulatory compliance.

The system’s scope covers all overhead distribution and sub‑transmission segments in HFTD Tiers 2–3 and their adjacent buffer zones. During Red Flag or Santa Ana conditions, it updates every 15 minutes; otherwise, it refreshes hourly. It supports three decision horizons: day‑ahead planning for the next 24–72 hours, near‑real‑time operations over the next 0–6 hours, and post‑event analysis after conditions normalize.

It ingests and time‑aligns multiple input domains. Weather data include wind gusts, sustained wind, relative humidity, temperature, precipitation, lightning, and stability indices. Fuels and terrain inputs cover live and dead fuel moisture proxies such as ERC and NDVI, slope and aspect, and historical burn perimeters. Grid‑asset data include conductor type (bare or covered), span information, protection devices such as reclosers and fuses, asset age and condition, inspection findings from UAS/IR/LiDAR, and recent work orders. Operations signals incorporate fault and momentary counts, load, switching states, prior PSPS footprints, and patrol outcomes. Vegetation data track clearance distances, overhangs, growth‑rate models, and any unresolved defects. Community and critical‑infrastructure context layers identify medical baseline customers, hospitals, water and wireless infrastructure, and access/egress constraints.

Each line segment receives a 0–100 risk score governed by an initial rubric to be tuned. A forecast wind gust exceeding 55 mph adds 25 points, while 45–55 mph adds 15. Relative humidity below 12% adds 15 points; 12–20% adds 10. If the Energy Release Component (ERC) is above the 90th seasonal percentile, 15 points are added; between the 80th and 90th percentiles, 10 are added. HFTD Tier 3 contributes 15 points and Tier 2 contributes 8. Any unresolved vegetation defect in the last 90 days adds 20 points. More than five momentaries in the past 30 days, or a recent ground fault, adds 10 points. A five‑year historical ignition density within one kilometer adds 10 points. Asset hardening—such as covered conductor or fast‑curve protection—reduces the score by 10 points, and wetting rain greater than 0.25 inches in the past 24 hours also reduces the score by 10.

Automated actions are tied to score thresholds, always with a human‑in‑the‑loop override. At scores of 85 or higher (Extreme), reclosing is disabled; the event is escalated to the Emergency Operations Center; patrols are initiated; and the system prepares a PSPS decision package that includes alternatives such as sectionalizing, mobile generation, and microgrids, while triggering a regulator‑compliant notifications workflow and sending a Slack or Teams alert to the Duty Officer and Communications. At 70–84 (Very High), the system applies sensitive protection settings, pre‑stages crews, schedules drone/IR patrols within 24 hours, issues customer advisories without promises, and generates contingency plans in the Outage and Advanced Distribution Management Systems (OMS/ADMS). At 55–69 (High), it schedules “quick‑hit” vegetation abatement within 72 hours, targets asset inspections, and reviews device coordination. At 40–54 (Elevated), it adds the segment to a rolling 30‑day work queue for vegetation and hardware and runs hardening simulations for the next capital‑planning cycle. Below 40 (Baseline), it monitors only.

For executive and operator decisions, the system auto‑generates a package that maps the top‑N risk segments and explains the drivers—for example, wind and fuels may account for 62 points of a segment’s score. It quantifies trade‑offs between expected ignition‑risk reduction and PSPS customer‑minutes, including exposure of critical loads. It ranks mitigation options, including sectionalizing plans, temporary reconfiguration, mobile generation, community resource centers, and the associated communications plan.

The platform integrates with Geographic Information Systems (e.g., Esri) for network topology; ADMS/OMS/SCADA for switching and telemetry; Enterprise Asset Management (e.g., SAP or Maximo) for work orders; Customer/Communications systems (e.g., Everbridge or Twilio) for notifications; and a Data Lake and Feature Store for model features. Identity and access are aligned to NERC‑CIP controls.

Reporting and performance management focus on safety, reliability, model quality, operations, and financial outcomes. Safety metrics include equipment‑caused ignitions, acres impacted, and near‑misses. Reliability metrics include PSPS customer‑minutes of interruption (CMI) and SAIDI/SAIFI segmented by HFTD versus non‑HFTD. Model metrics include precision and recall for top‑decile risk segments, lead‑time accuracy, and false‑positive rate. Operations metrics include patrol SLA adherence, time‑to‑decision, and crew utilization. Financial metrics include cost per avoided ignition and proxies for claim or litigation avoidance.

The system is designed with clear guardrails. It complies with CPUC requirements for wildfire, PSPS, and Wildfire Mitigation Plan reporting as well as customer‑contact obligations. Accessibility is built in so that Access and Functional Needs (AFN) populations receive redundant communication paths. Security and privacy controls enforce NERC‑CIP segmentation, exclude PII from field tools, and maintain audit logs for all automated decisions. A human override is required for any de‑energization, and every PSPS action must document the alternatives that were considered.

Acceptance criteria are explicit. Backtests over five or more years must show that at least 80% of historical equipment ignitions occurred in hours or segments that the system scored at 70 or higher. A live pilot spanning one fire season must demonstrate a 20% or greater ignition reduction in HFTD Tier 3 circuits versus matched controls and at least a 10% reduction in PSPS CMI with equal or better safety outcomes. Operators must rate the clarity and actionability of decision packages at 4 out of 5 or higher, and regulator reporting should be generated without manual rework.
The scoring, actions, and integrations can be tailored to a specific technology stack—for example, Esri with GE or Schneider ADMS and SAP or Maximo for asset management—and delivered as a concise, one‑page prompt specification suitable for direct handoff to a data and operations team.

* Monitor only.

### 4) Integrations & Contracts

**Esri**

* **Read**: Feature Services for line sections/devices, HFTD, AFN.
* **Write**: `RiskSegments` Feature Layer with fields:

## Prompt Spec B — *Esri ArcGIS + Schneider Electric EcoStruxure ADMS + IBM Maximo + Twilio + Snowflake* - Use a Different Prompt Spec for a different Technology Platform.

### 0) Objective

Deploy the same decision‑support outcomes as Spec A, tuned to **EcoStruxure ADMS** operations, **Maximo** work management, **Twilio** communications, and **Snowflake** analytics. Cadence, coverage, and horizons identical.

### 1) Inputs & Feature Catalog

* **Weather / Fuels / Terrain**: as in Spec A.
* **Esri/GIS**: identical structure; ensure **GlobalID** present for all line sections.
* **EcoStruxure ADMS**: LineSection persistent IDs (LSID), device inventory (reclosers/switches/fuses), **Protection Modes** library (Normal/Sensitive/Fire), feeder topology, OMS events, SCADA alarms.
* **Maximo**: assets (`ASSETNUM`), locations (`LOCATION`), inspection results (`INSPECTRESULT`), open vegetation defects, WOs (`WOTRACK`).
* **Historical ignitions** and **rain index**: as in Spec A.

> **Join keys & crosswalk**
>
> * `Esri.SectionId` ↔ `ADMS.LSID` (maintain **section\_id\_xwalk**).
> * `Esri.DeviceGUID` ↔ `ADMS.DeviceId`.
> * `Maximo.ASSETNUM` ↔ `Esri.AssetId`.
>   Canonical `section_id` = `ADMS.LSID`.

### 2) Risk Scoring (per `section_id`, 0–100)

Use the same base weights, with two Schneider‑specific tunings:

* **Protection Mode = Fire** already active on the section: additional **−5** (to avoid duplicate recommendations).
* **Fault Passage Indicator (FPI) alarms** last 7 days on the section: **+5** (proxy for intermittent contact risks).

Updated deltas (apply on top of base):

* `protection_mode_fire_active`: **−5**
* `fpi_alarm_7d`: **+5**

### 3) Actions by Threshold (human‑in‑the‑loop)

**Extreme (≥85)**

1. **EcoStruxure ADMS**:

   * Set **Protection Mode = Fire** for impacted sections; where supported, **Disable Reclosing** on named devices (`Operate Device` API).
   * Generate **Network Reconfiguration Study** with PSPS alternatives (sectionalize/back‑feed).
2. **Patrols**: immediate ground/UAS patrol tasking.
3. **Twilio**: prepare bilingual SMS/voice/IVR PSPS templates (no promise advisory + watch).
4. Decision Package for Duty Officer.

**Very High (70–84)**

* **EcoStruxure ADMS**: set **Sensitive Mode** (fast trip) on sections.
* **Crew Staging**: pre‑position resources; **UAS/IR within 24h**.
* **OMS**: run contingency; send Twilio advisory (FYI).

**High (55–69)**

* **Maximo**: auto‑create “quick‑hit” veg WOs (72h SLA) and targeted inspection WOs.
* **Protection Review**: confirm device coordination for the affected sections.

**Elevated (40–54)**

* **Maximo**: add to 30‑day veg/hardware plan; flag sections for capital hardening analysis.

**Baseline (<40)**

* Monitor only.

### 4) Integrations & Contracts

**Esri**

* Same `RiskSegments` feature layer and fields as Spec A.
* Provide **WebMap item** for ADMS/OMS operators with filter chips by `band`.

**EcoStruxure ADMS**

* **Input**: `risk-events` topic (Kafka/AMQP) — payload aligns to Spec A but includes **LSID**:

```json
{
  "section_id": "LSID-90210",
  "score": 91,
  "band": "EXTREME",
  "devices": ["RC-2201","RC-2203"],
  "recommended_mode": "FIRE",
  "expires_at": "2025-09-08T18:15:00Z"
}
```

* **Operate Device API** (logical example):

  * `POST /adms/device/{deviceId}/mode` → `{ "mode": "FIRE", "recloseEnabled": false }`
* **Study/Plan API**: `POST /adms/study/reconfigure` with candidate isolation/back‑tie points; returns `study_id` for operator review.

**Maximo**

* **Create WO** (via REST/Integration Framework):

```json
{
  "wonum": null,
  "worktype": "VEG-QUICK",
  "priority": 2,
  "location": "LSID-90210",
  "description": "Quick-hit veg abatement due to Very High risk",
  "targetfinish": "2025-09-11T23:59:00Z",
  "longdescription": "Drivers: wind, RH, ERC; see Esri RiskSegments for map.",
  "esri_section_id": "LSID-90210"
}
```

* Backwrite `wonum` to `RiskSegments`.

**Twilio**

* **Templates**: `wildfire_advisory`, `psps_watch`, `psps_warning` with localization (`en`, `es`) and AFN routing.
* **Trigger**: from Decision Package with Esri geofence; capture `sid`/status for audit.

**Snowflake**

* **Schemas**: `RAW`, `FEATURES`, `RISK`, `OPS`.
* **Tables**: `FEATURES.SECTION_15MIN`, `RISK.SCORES_15MIN`, `RISK.EVENTS`, `OPS.ACTIONS_AUDIT`, `OPS.WO`, `OPS.NOTIFICATIONS`.
* **Streams/Tasks** for incremental scoring & audit rollups.

### 5) Governance, Security, Guardrails

* Same as Spec A; ensure ADMS operations require **two‑person approval** for any PSPS‑related action; all writes are **append‑only** with immutable logs.

### 6) Decision Package

* Same structure as Spec A, with ADMS study IDs and Maximo WO references. Twilio campaign drafts attached.

### 7) KPIs & Acceptance Tests

* Same targets as Spec A; add **FPI alarm correlation** precision/recall for Schneider telemetry.

## Common Implementation Details (both stacks)

### A) Run Logic

* **Scheduler**: run scoring every **15 min** during Red Flag/Santa Ana; else hourly.
* **Windows**: produce `near_real_time` (0–6h) and `day_ahead` (24–72h) scores; label outputs with `window_start/end`.
* **Idempotency**: key by `(section_id, window_start, window_end)`; re‑runs update same row/version.
* **Explainability**: persist driver attributions; surface top 3 in UIs.

### B) Operator UX

* Single **Esri Web App** showing sections color‑ramped by band; click reveals score, drivers, suggested actions, linked WOs/Plans/Comms.
* **One‑click** to open ADMS plan, Maximo WO, and Comms campaign draft.

### C) Error Handling & Data Quality

* If critical inputs missing (e.g., wind or RH), **degrade gracefully**: label scores `DEGRADED`, suppress auto‑suggested actions above `HIGH`.
* Emit `dq_alerts` topic when inputs stale > 1 hour.

### D) Observability

* Metrics: pipeline latency, percent sections scored on time, feature freshness, action acceptance rate, PSPS CMI, ignition proxy outcomes, operator overrides.
* Dashboards by band, feeder, and HFTD tier.

### E) Deployment & Security

* Network segmentation per NERC‑CIP; outbound‑only from ADMS zone via broker/proxy where required.
* Secrets in vault; signed containers; RBAC tied to enterprise IAM; all command suggestions require authenticated user approval.

## What to Hand the Team (deliverables checklist)

1. `risk_config.json` (weights/thresholds; one per stack).
2. **Data contracts** (Avro/JSON): `risk-events`, `adms-actions`, `dq_alerts`.
3. **Esri**: `RiskSegments` schema + WebMap/WebApp item definitions.
4. **ADMS**: example payloads for Protection Mode and Switching Plan APIs (GE & Schneider variants).
5. **EAM**: SAP/Maximo WO create examples; field mapping tables.
6. **Comms**: Everbridge/Twilio templates with merge fields (geofence polygon, window, band, AFN tags).
7. **Backtest notebook** and **acceptance test script** producing KPI set.
8. **Runbook**: who approves what at each band; rollback steps; audit locations.

### Optional: minimal “single‑page prompt” for a build sprint kickoff

> **Build an end‑to‑end Wildfire Ignition Risk & PSPS Decision‑Support system** with Esri + \[GE ADMS **or** Schneider ADMS] + \[SAP **or** Maximo] + \[Everbridge **or** Twilio] + \[Databricks/ADLS **or** Snowflake]. Score each `section_id` every 15 min (Red Flag) or hourly otherwise, using the exact weights defined in `risk_config.json` above. Publish scores and recommended actions to a `risk-events` topic and to an Esri `RiskSegments` feature layer. When `band ∈ {EXTREME, VERY_HIGH}`, generate ADMS protection mode suggestions (GE: Fire‑Safety profile; Schneider: Protection Mode = Fire), a Switching Plan/Study for sectionalizing alternatives, and a Decision Package summarizing risk drivers and PSPS trade‑offs with geofenced comms drafts. For `HIGH` and `ELEVATED`, create Maximo/SAP work orders per the thresholds. Enforce human‑in‑the‑loop for any ADMS changes and all PSPS. Log every suggestion/action to `actions_audit`. Acceptance: backtest ≥80% recall for historical equipment ignitions at score ≥70; pilot shows ≥20% ignition reduction and ≥10% PSPS CMI reduction; operators rate packages ≥4/5; regulator reporting produces with no manual rework.
